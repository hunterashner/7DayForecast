# 7DayForecast
I was sick of my patio cushions blowing away during windy days, 
so I used the open weather map API to collect some weather data 
that would warn me about any windy days coming up.

The Js source successfully
-fetches json from the open weather map API
based upon latitude and longitude coordinates.

-converts unix epoch time to local time.

-converts kelvins to fahrenheit for temperature data.

-parses data and cleans up undefined data.

-shows 7 forecast with a basic bootstrap4
layout.
